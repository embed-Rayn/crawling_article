Three sessions of PDL were additionally performed immediately after QSNY treatment on the half of the face at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The melasma area and the severity index (MASI) score was calculated at the baseline, one week after the last treatment (week 9), as well as at the follow-up 8 weeks after the last treatment (week 16). Dermoscopic images at the baseline were classified as to whether the visibly widened capillaries were detected or not.\",\n",

There was no significant difference in the MASI score change between both sides in all periods. However, seven patients who had visibly widened capillaries on dermoscopy showed significant difference in both sides in terms of changes in the MASI score during treatment.\"\n",

This places affected patients at an increased risk of early cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Moreover, many of the therapeutic options, including the newer biologics, used in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa have both beneficial and adverse metabolic effects. Therefore, it is critical for physicians to consider the complex interactions between the disease process and the treatment options in the holistic management of these patients with an intrinsically higher risk of metabolic consequences. Other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis have been studied more extensively with regard to their associations and share an underlying link with the metabolic syndrome; we can draw upon the existing knowledge in our understanding and management of hidradenitis suppurativa.\",\n",
